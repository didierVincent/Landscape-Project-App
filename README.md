![TITLE (ADD UPDATED IMAGE HERE)]

## TECHNOLOGY USED (DOUBLE CHECK LATER)

NODE, EXPRESS, MONGODB, MONGOOSE, CSS & JAVASCRIPT
<BR> (CREATED IN VISUAL STUDIO CODE)

## NEXT STEPS

- USE APIS TO FETCH UP TO DATE PRODUCT DATA
- FOR CONTRACTORS:
  - ABILITY TO ADD MARGIN / LABOUR COSTS TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE QUOTE.
    <BR> HAVE A 'SHOW/HIDE' TOGGLE BUTTON TO INCLUDE MARGIN/LABOUR COSTS FROM VIEW.
    <BR> (THINKING OF HAVING AN OPTION TO KEEP THOSE COSTS HIDDEN DURING A LIVE QUOTATION WITH A CLIENT)
- CREATE COMPATIBLE MOBILE BROWSER APP
- CREATE IOS/ANDRIOD APP
