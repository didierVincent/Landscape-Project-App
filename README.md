# Landscape Project Builder App! (Item List App)

**Unit 2 Project - Node/Express/MongoDB Full-stack CRUD Application**
<BR> (will come up with an app name later)

## Description

**Quickly build your own comprehensive list of building and hardware products for your next Landscaping Project!**
<BR>
Project builder app to calculate costs for personal projects, or for contractors looking to make quick quotes for clients.

## Getting Started!

**Here's a link my app!:** (insert render.com link here later when deployed)

## Technology Used (double check later)

Node, Express, MongoDB, Mongoose, CSS & JavaScript
<BR> (Created in Visual Studio Code)

## Next Steps

- Use APIs to fetch up to date product data
- For contractors:
  - Ability to add margin / labour costs to create a comprehensive quote.
    <BR> Have a 'Show/Hide' toggle button to include margin/labour costs from view.
    <BR> (Thinking of having an option to keep those costs hidden during a live quotation with a client)
- Create compatible Mobile Browser App
- Create IOS/Andriod App

## Database ER Diagram

## Roadmap

- [ ] Create App with basic item list builder functionality, with hard coded mock up data (no APIs)
- [ ] Use real products and prices from suppliers, hard code current values
- [ ] Implement APIs to database to fetch up-to-date prices for products
- [ ] (add more below)

## Stories (in order of priority)

- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to create an item list with building and hardware products with their prices included.
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to save my items lists as projects so I can access them later.
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to create multiple projects (item lists of products)
- [ ] As a user, I want to be able to edit or delete a project I have created.

### Optional Stories (in order of priority)

- [ ] As a user, I want the product prices to be accurate and up to date. (API implementation)

# To Do

### Create Mock Up Data for app

- [x] Create an ER Diagram to plan product database
- [x] Hard code a mock up product list of items for database
- [x] Categorise some products into landscape types (Eg. Decking, Retaining Wall)
- [x] Mock up product prices

### Create Wireframe

- [x] Draft wireframe, including all different views
- [ ] Finalise wireframe in Figma

### Create Express App

- [ ] Create basic views and routes
- [ ]
- [ ]
- [ ]

### Create Item List Page

### Refactor using Real Data

- [ ] Find realistic products from competitive suppliers, and replace database
- [ ] Use APIs where available to retrieve up to date prices

### OAuth

- [ ] Setup OAuth for user login

### Things to refactor

### Things to debug

### Optional Setup

- [ ] Find supplier APIs and test if you can fetch product prices from them:
- [ ] Bunnings API
- [ ] (other supplier) API
- [ ] (other supplier) API
